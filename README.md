# AmigaTraces-GFA_Source
BASIC source for the forerunner of Blender

described here: [Blenderâ€™s prehistory - Traces on Commodore Amiga (1987-1991)](http://zgodzinski.com/blender-prehistory/)

as extracted on the Atari forum by another user: [convert Amiga GFA Basic file to Atari - Atari-Forum](http://www.atari-forum.com/viewtopic.php?t=33479#p342982)

Source files are renamed from `*.LST` to `*_LST.txt`. They're also very unlikely to run with an absurdly-specified emulator setup.

Files are too big for a gist, and are provided for historical interest. No issues will be accepted.
